**Important features of FastAPI:**

- <span style="background-color: fuchsia;">**Speed**</span>: FastAPI is very fast due to its use of asynchronous Python features and optimised techniques.
<br>
- <span style="background-color: fuchsia;">**Typing**</span>: FastAPI uses Python types to define your API endpoints. This facilitates static analysis and helps create secure APIs.
<br>
- <span style="background-color: fuchsia;">**Simple syntax**</span>: FastAPI uses Python code annotations to define routes and data models. This makes the code readable and understandable.
<br>
- <span style="background-color: fuchsia;">**Support for WebSockets**</span>: FastAPI offers support for WebSockets, so you can build real-time applications.
<br>
- <span style="background-color: fuchsia;">**Embedded validation and serialisation**</span>: FastAPI facilitates input validation and output serialisation, which simplifies the development of robust APIs.

**Important components and functions of MLflow:**

- <span style="background-color: fuchsia;">**Tracking**</span>: MLflow allows logging of experiments and tracking of metrics, parameters and models during the training process. This helps in tracking and comparing experiments to find out which model performs best.
<br>
- <span style="background-color: fuchsia;">**Projects**</span>: With MLflow you can organise machine learning projects in a consistent structure that contains all the necessary dependencies and configurations. This facilitates the reproducibility of models.
<br>
- <span style="background-color: fuchsia;">**Model Registry**</span>: The Model Registry component of MLflow allows you to manage and version models. You can organise models in a catalogue-like system to ensure that you always have access to the correct model version.
<br>
- <span style="background-color: fuchsia;">**Model Deployment**</span>: MLflow provides interfaces for deploying machine learning models in different environments, including cloud services, container orchestrations and local servers. This facilitates the transition of models from development to production.
<br>
- <span style="background-color: fuchsia;">**Support for various ML frameworks**</span>: MLflow is framework-agnostic and supports various machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn and more.
<br>
- <span style="background-color: fuchsia;">**Integrations**</span>: There are integrations of MLflow with various tools and platforms, including Jupyter Notebooks, Apache Spark and many popular cloud platforms.
